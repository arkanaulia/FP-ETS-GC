**Authors:** Osamah Ansari (<oaansari@umich.edu>)


## Background

This repository showcases the end result of the research conducted in Fall 2020 at the University of Michigan for my independent research project, **[Project Talos](https://projecttalos.com/)**. 
Project Talos sought to research into the application of machine learning in game development.  

The end goals of this project were as follows:
- Create a simple, yet enjoyable game centered around machine learning agents
- Documenting the process on a weekly basis
- Show the viability of machine learning in game development


## Results

- A publically released, fully playable game using machine learning agents as a central feature
	- Received overwhelmingly positive feedback on said game
- A website documenting the full journey of the research project
	- Contains weekly developer blogs

Lost Fantasy Itch.io Description:
> You are a flower having a nightmare where you are chased by hummingbirds who want nothing but to drink all your nectar. Failing to escape them will result in your untimely       demise. Do you have what it takes to escape the machine learning hummingbirds?!
